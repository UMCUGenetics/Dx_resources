This -perl- script can be used to calculate SNP/INDEL precision and sensitivity of a (filtered) vcf to a certain truth set version. If two vcf files are provided, these data are compared to each other, and the overlapping variants (tp.vcf.gz from rtgtools) is compared to the nist truthset.

Trackfile manipulation is done with GATK SelectVariants, with the options --excludeNonVariants --removeUnusedAlternates

Usage:  compare_vcf_to_giab_truth.pl 	
			-vcf [v] vcf file to analyse [],
			-nist [n] NIST consensus version (v2.19|v3.3.2) [v2.19],
			-sample [s] Samplename in test vcf [GIAB12878],
			-vcf2 [v2] vcffile to use as truthset for duplo measurements; overlap (true positives) will be compared to nist,
			-sample2 [s2] samplename in vcf2, 
			-bed bed [b] file to analyse, ie exome [/hpc/cog_bioinf/diagnostiek/production/Dx_tracks/Tracks/ENSEMBL_UCSC_merged_collapsed_sorted_v3_20bpflank.bed],
			-high_conf [c] bed file with high confident regions [],
			-t threads to use during analyses [6],
